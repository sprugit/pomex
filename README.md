# pomex
pomex (POM extractor) is a program I was tasked to write to ease up documentation of dependency management by recursively digging into directories, seeking all pom.xml files of a given Java project and retrieving all dependencies, their respective versions, their maven repository addresses and their latest version.
The original version of this project was a python script that implemented some form of multithreading to speed up the process.
This version of pomex will be rewritten in GOlang.
